# PuppyAdoptionApp
A nice puppy adoption app written in Kotlin with Jetpack compose

This challenge was initiated when Google was about to release jetpack compose in beta. 
Each week they would release a challenge where only the first 500 people to complete it would win. 
I participated in this challenge and was part of the first 500 people to win.
